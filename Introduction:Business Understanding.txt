Introduction/Business Understanding

1.1 Description of the problem
New York City, the Empire State, is well-known as the BEST city on this planet. However, as a foodie who living around Greater Toronto Area, I confidently propose Toronto City as a decent rivalry to challenge New York on who is the more multicultural city in catering aspect.

1.2 Discussion of the background

According to the report, Toronto’s 2020 population is now estimated at 6,196,731, it ranked as the fourth biggest city in North America. The racial composition is also diverse: White: 50.2% ,East Asian:12.7% (10.8% Chinese, 1.4% Korean, 0.5% Japanese) South Asian: 12.3% Black: 8.5% Southeast Asian: 7.0% (5.1% Filipino) Latin American: 2.8% and others.

The most common ancestry groups were: English (12.9%), Chinese (12.0%), Canadian (11.3%), Irish (9.7%), Scottish (9.5%), East Indian (7.6%), Italian (6.9%), Filipino (5.5%), German (4.6%), French (4.5%), and Polish (3.8%). Other common groups include Portuguese, Jamaican, Jewish, Ukrainian and Russian.

Toronto is known for being the most multicultural in the world, and the city promotion motto just like what it represents, “Diversity our strength”, which also means people can have ethnic and authentic foods from all over the world. Toronto features ethnic supermarkets, farmers markets, cultural specific or diet specific restaurants and festivals that celebrate cultural diversity. Whether you want to try something new or eat something that reminds you of home. Different ethnic neighborhoods throughout the cit include Chinatown, K-town, Greektown, Little India and Little Italy. 

On the other hand, New York is also famous for diversity and the melting pot of different races and cultures. More than 8 million population in New York composited by 65.7% white, 15.9% black, 7.3% Asian, and 7.4% of other races. 

Both two cities have the incredible cultural diversity and has become the classic rivalry on who is the better city when it comes to food and catering, I will utilize the data from Foursquare and Yelp to generate the distribution of the restaurants and food courts, and also to see its diversity and scale, the customer ranking and viewing is also an aspect to evaluate its impact.

In general, the criteria will be:

1 The total number of different cuisines, and the per capita. 
2 The total number of each diverse cuisines in each neighborhood 
3 The evaluation of the cuisines customers ranking and reviews
